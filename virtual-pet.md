virtual-pet

Overview
For my second weekend project,
I am creating a virtual pet similar to the one seen in the late 1990's. The virtual pet is named Hold and Hold will be able to inform its owner when it needs various tasks to be completed. For example, when Hold is either hungry or thirsty. It is up to the Owner of Hold to keep their virtual pet happy.
